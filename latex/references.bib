	abstract = {The authors propose a model-based method for fully automated bias field correction of MR brain images. The MR signal is modeled as a realization of a random process with a parametric probability distribution that is corrupted by a smooth polynomial inhomogeneity or bias field. The method the authors propose applies an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) strategy that interleaves pixel classification with estimation of class distribution and bias field parameters, improving the likelihood of the model parameters at each iteration. The algorithm, which can handle multichannel data and slice-by-slice constant intensity offsets, is initialized with information from a digital brain atlas about the a priori expected location of tissue classes. This allows full automation of the method without need for user interaction, yielding more objective and reproducible results. The authors have validated the bias correction algorithm on simulated data and they illustrate its performance on various MR images with important field inhomogeneities. They also relate the proposed algorithm to other bias correction algorithms.},

The method interleaves classification with estimation of the model parameters, improving the classification at each iteration.

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to address this bias in the context of nonlinear registration, but little work has been done for global registration. We propose a symmetric approach based on a block-matching technique and least-trimmed square regression. The proposed method is suitable for multimodal registration and is robust to outliers in the input images. The symmetric framework is compared with the original asymmetric block-matching technique and is shown to outperform it in terms of accuracy and robustness. The methodology presented in this article has been made available to the community as part of the NiftyReg open-source package.},

The aim of the work is to explore how a hierarchical generative model of imaging data, which captures simultaneously the distribution of signal intensities and the variability of anatomical shapes across a large population of subjects, can serve to quantitatively investigate, in vivo, the morphology of the central nervous system (CNS). In fact, the generality of the proposed Bayesian approach, which extends the hierarchical structure of the segmentation method implemented in the SPM software, allows processing simultaneously information relative to different compartments of the CNS, namely the brain and the spinal cord, without having to resort to organ specific solutions (e.g. tools optimised only for the brain, or only for the spinal cord), which are inevitably harder to integrate and generalise.},

Nevertheless they have not yet been fully exploited for image processing applications. In this paper we present a variational Bayes (VB) approach for image segmentation. We aim to show that VB provides a framework for generalising existing segmentation algorithms that rely on an expectation–maximisation formulation, while increasing their robustness and computational stability. We also show how optimal model complexity can be automatically determined in a variational setting, as opposed to ML frameworks which are intrinsically prone to overfitting. Finally, we demonstrate how suitable intensity priors, that can be used in combination with the presented algorithm, can be learned from large imaging data sets by adopting an empirical Bayes approach.},

	abstract = {Despite the constant improvement of algorithms for automated brain tissue classification, the accurate delineation of subcortical structures using magnetic resonance images (MRI) data remains challenging. The main difficulties arise from the low gray-white matter contrast of iron rich areas in T1-weighted (T1w) MRI data and from the lack of adequate priors for basal ganglia and thalamus. The most recent attempts to obtain such priors were based on cohorts with limited size that included subjects in a narrow age range, failing to account for age-related gray-white matter contrast changes. Aiming to improve the anatomical plausibility of automated brain tissue classification from T1w data, we have created new tissue probability maps for subcortical gray matter regions. Supported by atlas-derived spatial information, raters manually labeled subcortical structures in a cohort of healthy subjects using magnetization transfer saturation and R2* MRI maps, which feature optimal gray-white matter contrast in these areas. After assessment of inter-rater variability, the new tissue priors were tested on T1w data within the framework of voxel-based morphometry. The automated detection of gray matter in subcortical areas with our new probability maps was more anatomically plausible compared to the one derived with currently available priors. We provide evidence that the improved delineation compensates age-related bias in the segmentation of iron rich subcortical regions. The new tissue priors, allowing robust detection of basal ganglia and thalamus, have the potential to enhance the sensitivity of voxel-based morphometry in both healthy and diseased brains.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the vast amount of information that is rapidly accumulating about the human brain in digital form, we embarked upon a program in 1992 to develop a four-dimensional probabilistic atlas and reference system for the human brain. Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) a dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono- and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. DNA has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component of the programme uses post-mortem tissue to determine the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto- and chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined with macroscopic information about structure and function derived from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance in micro- and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy, strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and validation methods are described in this report along with database structures. Examples of results are described for the normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to quantify the variance of the human brain as a function of age in a large population of subjects for whom data is also available about their genetic composition and behaviour will allow for the first assessment of cerebral genotype-phenotype-behavioural correlations in humans to take place in a population this large. This approach and its application should provide new insights and opportunities for investigators interested in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics and the evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a rapid growth in the use of 3D multi-modal correlative imaging for studies of the human brain. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes indicate brain areas involved in stimulus processing. These focal changes are often too small ({\textless}10\%) to be discerned from a single subject and the experiment is repeated in a series of individuals. To investigate the extent of residual variability the authors have collected over 300 MRI volumetric datasets from normal individuals and transformed these datasets into stereotaxic space using a 3D linear re-sampling algorithm. The authors then generated a series of statistical measures which express this population nonlinear variability in the form of parametric volumes, e.g. mean intensity, intensity variance. A model for anatomical variability, expressed as the width of a Gaussian blurring kernel applied to an ideal single subject, was developed and tested against the observed data},
